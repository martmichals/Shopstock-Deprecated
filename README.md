# Shopstock

An app developed in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Uses user-reported data in order to provide out-of-stock data on stores in the
United States. Meant to limit unnecessary exposure to others in supermarkets by enabling users to ensure the product they are looking for is in stock.<br>

-- Still in active development --<br>


<h2>App Setup</h2>
<b>Android Studio:</b><br>
File -> New -> Project from Version Control... -> Git <br>
Copy the following link:<br>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
The app requires the use of the Google Map API, which requries an API key which can be obtained at:
https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key
and then entered into the "api_map_key" item in the "strings.xml" file.
